# Wallet Frontend  https://walletpr.netlify.app/ 🏦

## Overview 📝

This project was created by a team of 7 students under the guidance of experienced web developers.
The site was built based on a figma design and strict technical specifications.
Some practices that may seem unconventional are a result of adhering closely to those requirements.

The Wallet is a React application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing personal
finances. It integrates with the API backend, allowing users to register, login, view their profile,
and edit their transactions. The app offers various features such as a home page with transaction
lists, balance, and currency prices, a charts page for expense breakdown and filtering, and a
currencies page displaying just the prices.

This project includes custom backend designed and coded strictly for this app:
